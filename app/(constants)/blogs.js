High performing websites get more traffic, they are ranked higher in search engines and perform better overall when talking about converting users. The good news is that Webflow takes most of the important factors out of the equation and provides an out of the box solution that automatically sets your website up for success. 
Here is a short list of the tools that Webflow has integrated into its website builder in order to achieve higher page speed performance results:`,

For example, if you download a single image directly from Unsplash or Pexels and upload it in Webflow you will most probably be fine and not need to optimize further.
          
          If you however have 20-30 images on the same page, you will most probably end up with performance issues. Especially, if you are in Admin mode and trying to edit something, it saves the original image and that can result in very slow load time.`,

You can make your image borders rounded in Webflow so don’t be deceived by the fact something has a border radius and it should be exported with it. The proper way is to export it without border radius and do it afterwards in Webflow. This way you can guarantee if someone replaces the image, it will remain with the same border radius.`,

<span class="text-black">After deciding the format, make sure to export it no more than 2X of the required image size. 2X is good for retina displays. For example, if your original image is 500x500px, you can export your asset in 1000x1000px but no bigger than that.</span>

This content is called DOM content and it can be an image, non-white canvas element, or an SVG.

When coming up with an FCP score, the calculation is based on your website’s page FCP time and that of other real websites. For example, a good FCP time is anything below 1.5 seconds. That will put your website in the 99-percentile in terms of performance.`,

One could calculate this by adding the blocking time for all long tasks which run on the main thread between FCP and TTI for more than 50 milliseconds. The blocking time occurs once the long tasks exceed 50 ms. For example, if a certain main thread timeline detects a 90 ms long task, the blocking time would be 40 ms.`,

In order to ensure a high-quality user experience, a good CLS score needs to be less than 0.1. If it’s between 0.1 and 0.25 it would require some improvement, and if it exceeds 0.25, it’s considered poor.`,
